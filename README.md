# Fictional Bakery Project
This project is a website for a fictional bakery, created as part of my education in web development with .NET. The project focuses on basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is designed to present a fictional bakery online. It includes information about the company, displays products and offers, and allows visitors to explore the bakery's assortment.
